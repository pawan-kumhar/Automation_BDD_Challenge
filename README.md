This is an automation testing framework created for login feature as well order tracking.
To implement this automation we have nightwatch API because of below few benefits-
    -Lightweight framework
    -Robust configuration
    -Integrates with cloud servers web and mobile testing with JavaScript, Appium (I need to use javascript)
    -Allows configuration with Cucumber to build a strong BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) setup
    -High performance of the automation execution
    -Improves test structuring
    -Minimum usage and less Maintenance of code
 To write test scenario BDD framework used and to use BDD,Gherkins(readable from end user) language is used to write symple test scenarios.
 To test this automation suits-simply run two commands like 'npm install'(use to build packages for dependices added for this framework) and 'npm test' to run test scenrion of login and cart.

Following are the some challenges faced while working on this-
-Finding location elements through CSS selectors techniue as i have never used this but I tried.
-sometimes website is not responsive and giving some unusual error.

Thank you
